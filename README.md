# UFOs

Overview
  To create an interactive site for people to easily sort or filter through UFO data based on location, shape, date, etc.

Resuts 
  We have been able to create a very user friendly site that can quickly and easily shift through different UFO data with just a few clicks.
  Instructions 
    1 - Once you are on the site, please familiarize yourself with the layout
    2 - Use the table on the left to sort the info on the right
    3 - You can use just 1 filter, or all filters, or a combination of filters to narrow down the results
    4 - Enjoy!

Summary
  This is a great first iteration! However with just a little fine tuning this could really take off. One drawback is that the table to filter the data is very picky on what the user needs to type in. This would be much more user friendly if it could be more flexible or even have a drop down list to help the user see what is available. Another recommendation to consider would be to have results table include links for the UFOs.  These links could be to source evidence for the UFO or stories or really anything that could bring value to the user.
